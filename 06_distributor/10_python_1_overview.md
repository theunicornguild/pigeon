At this point everything should work fine, test out your work and make sure you are recieving emails and SMS messages (although keep in mind SMS might not work 100% of the time due to some companies blocking nexmo or other SMS providers because of spam so check with more than one phone number to make sure)

# Trello

Move the cards in the `Doing` section to the `Review` section and make sure everything works perfectly and get someone to review your work if possible, After that move them to the `Done` section

# Git

Create a new checkpoint

```bash
git add .
git commit -m “Finished sending emails & sms messages”
git push
```
