Now that we are finished with importing & exporting recipients and even searching for them easily within the admin page we can start testing what we did so go to the admin page and play around a bit and if everything is working perfectly, we can move on to Trello and Git

## Trello

> Move the cards in the `Doing` section to the `Review` and check if everything is perfect and maybe get someone else to check your work before moving them to the `Done` section

## Git

**Create a new checkpoint**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m “Finished importing & exporting”
git push
```
