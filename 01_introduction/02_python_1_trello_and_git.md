In this project you'll be using both `trello` and `git`.


#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work. What you need to do, what you've already finished and so on. It's a project management tool, or that's what we'll be using it for.

Open the projects `Trello` board, which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 5 lists:
 * `IceBox`: this list has all the features that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
 * `Backlog`: this list has all the features that we need to do.
 * `Doing`: this list will have all the features that you are currently working on.
 * `Review`: this list will have all the features that you finished but need to be reviewed by someone.
 * `Done`: this list will have all the features that are done.


\*Right now you'll see cards in the `Backlog` list and the `done` list. The cards that are in the `backlog` list are the features that you'll be creating throughout this tutorial. While the the cards in the `done` list are features already built in the starter repository that you'll be building on top of. So, as we start working in this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists.

Before you can move the cards, you need to copy the board into your account. Click [here](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards) to see how to do that.

#### Git

We'll be using git throughout the project to keep track of the changes we're making to the code, and create checkpoints everytime we finish a feature.

We're not going to start this project from scratch, there is a starter repo for you. After you `fork` and `clone` this project, each time we complete a certain feature we'll `push` to that repo. If you're not familiar with `forking` and `cloning`, we'll go through that in the setup, or you could checkout our workshop on Git [here](https://codeunicorn.io/p/basics-of-git).
