In this chapter we’ve covered some new concepts

Customizing the admin page header itself and linking existing models to it!
Changed the way we view recipients in a specific group details page
Added a limit to the amount of groups we can see (pagination)
We can search for a specific group by name

Now we can go to our admin page and check the new changes and see if everything is working perfectly, After you are done checking let’s jump to Trello and Git

## Trello

Move the cards in `Doing` section to the `Review` section and if everything is working and maybe have a friend of a colleague review the code, After that move the cards to the `Done` section

## Git

Create a new checkout

```bash
git add .
git commit -m “Finished customizing group model & new admin page header”
git push
```
