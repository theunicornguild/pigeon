To help you continue to build your skills, I have a few suggestions to help you build on what you've already learned.

- Try and use what you just learned on an already existing project.
- Add more features and improvements to how the Quick List works (jQuery in the add/remove buttons)

These are just ideas on how you can improve on what you learned in this project.

On the other hand, If you'd like to work on something else to improve your skills in django, I would suggest [My Rent](https://codeunicorn.io/p/my-rent). As it would touch upon different advanced topics I did not get into in this project,

Best of luck
