In this chapter you will be creating recipients that will be receiving emails & SMS message along with the groups that will hold recipients in them to make it easier organizing which group will be receiving which email/sms

As you know most of this tutorial will cover the admin page only, So you will create a superuser using the command line, and will login/logout using the Django admin page

And for creating/editing/deleting/listing groups/recipients we will also be using the Django admin page

##Trello:

> Move the following to Done as they are already done by default in Django

- As an admin I can login to the website
- As an admin I can logout

> And move the following to `Doing` as we will be creating models in the next chapter

- As an admin I can add a recipient
- As an admin I can edit a recipient
- As an admin I can list all recipients
- As an admin I can delete a recipient
- As an admin I can add a group
- As an admin I can list all groups
- As an admin I can edit a group
- As an admin I can delete a group

This might seem like a lot! But keep in mind as we said previously all CRUD will be handled using the Django admin interface so we will be just creating the models and linking them to the admin page at this time
