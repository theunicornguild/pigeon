Let’s create a virtual environment that will hold this project files and packages so it won’t affect other projects you are currently working on or will work on in the future, I will mostly call it a `virtual env` as a shortcut

To create a virtual env open up your command line, weather it was mac or windows

```shell
	python3 -m venv env
	cd env
```

If you are using mac/linux

```shell
	source bin/activate
```

If you are using windows

```shell
	\Scripts\activate
```
